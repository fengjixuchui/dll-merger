# ðŸ”— dll-merger
Merging DLLs with a PE32 EXE without LoadLibrary.

# Building the project

# Principle of merging
dll-merger merges DLLs with one PE32 EXE and injects the loader code into the PE32 EXE and the injected loader loads DLLs manually without LoadLibrary and thus the loaded DLLs are invisible in the PEB.

# Demonstration
1. Execute ```merger.exe procexp.exe MyDLL.dll```
2. ```procexp.exe_out.exe``` is created
3. ```MyDLL.dll``` is manually loaded in the ```procexp.exe_out.exe``` when ```procexp.exe_out.exe``` is executed but it's invisible.
